<p>A new study that is being presented this week at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ecs-acc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American College of Cardiology Middle East 2022 Together With the 13th Emirates Cardiac Society Congress</a>, reports that eating more refined grains was linked with a greater risk for premature coronary artery disease (PCAD).</p>

<p>Additionally, consuming whole grains was associated with reduced risk.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8772521/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coronary artery diseaseTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;(CAD) is characterized by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle due to a buildup of atherosclerotic plaques in the heart’s arteries. It is considered to be premature when it develops at an earlier age than generally expected. For this study, those ages were defined as 55 for women and 65 for men.</p>

<p>PCAD can lead to chest pain or heart attack as the coronary artery narrows or plaques rupture and block blood flow. Smoking, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes put people at greater risk for developing this condition.</p>

<p>This study is significant because it is one of the first to look at how the type of grain eaten is related to heart disease in a Middle Eastern population. The study participants were all citizens of Iran.</p>

<p>The team of researchers, led by Mohammad Amin Khajavi Gaskarei, MD, of the Isfahan Cardiovascular Research Center and Cardiovascular Research Institute at Isfahan University of Medical Sciences in Isfahan, Iran, recruited 2,099 people with PCAD from various Iranian hospitals who had undergone coronary angiography (X-ray imaging of the heart’s blood vessels).</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Altogether, 1,168 people with healthy coronary arteries were recruited, while there were 1,369 who had CAD with blockages equal to or above 75% in at least one coronary artery or equal to or above 50% in the left main coronary artery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Their diet was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire to see how much whole or refined grains they were taking in before being diagnosed with heart disease.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Upon analysis of the data, it was found that higher intakes of refined grains were associated with increased PCAD risk. Higher intakes of whole grains, on the other hand, were linked to reduced risk.</p>
