<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robin-young-07803215a/?originalSubdomain=uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robin Young</a>&nbsp;has autism spectrum disorder, which, in his case, means he struggles to empathize and show love for someone else. The resident of Bodicote, England, is also a father.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This is something I’ve always had. However, when I became a dad, I found that the love for my children was different,” Young told Healthline. “Not only was this strong feeling of love new, but it also enabled me to empathize better because I finally understood what others feel when they say they love someone.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Young – the chief executive officer of workout supply company Fitness Savvy – said he believes his outlook on life improved after having children and planning for their future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“People think that it is just your priorities that change when you become a parent, but it would make perfect sense that the brain goes through changes as well,” Young said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s likely correct, according to researchers from the University of Southern California (USC).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They say women aren’t the only ones who go through physical change when becoming parents. Men’s brains undergo measurable changes after their babies arrive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s right. They get “dad brain.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Their&nbsp;<a href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhac333/6691667?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&nbsp;published in the journal&nbsp;<em>Cerebral Cortex</em>&nbsp;­­reports that some of those changes involve slight brain shrinkage. They add that brain changes in new fathers mostly affect areas linked to empathy and visual processing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The scientists believe those changes contribute to neuroplasticity, which is the brain’s ability to create and form new synaptic connections to adapt to new experiences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Becoming a parent entails changes to your lifestyle and your biology,” said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/darbysaxbe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Darby Saxbe</a>, the study’s senior author and a professor of psychology at USC’s Dornsife College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences, in a&nbsp;<a href="https://news.usc.edu/202441/dad-brain-is-real-study-reveals-mens-brains-change-after-baby-arrives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a>. “And it requires new skills like being able to empathize with a nonverbal infant, so it makes sense but has not been proven that the brain would be particularly plastic during the transition to parenthood as well.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Details from the study</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The study examined the brain scans of 40 expectant fathers — 20 in the United States and 20 in Spain. Researchers also looked at a group of 17 childless fathers who were scanned in Spain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The researchers identified that the most significant changes in the expectant fathers occurred in the cortex — the brain’s outer layer managing attention, planning, and executive functioning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Comparisons made before and after the babies were born showed changes where the brain processes visual information and areas that are part of the brain’s default mode network.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The childless men had no such changes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This is such an important and neglected topic,”&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mindpath.com/staff/zishan-khan-md/" target="_blank">Dr. Zishan Khan,</a>&nbsp;a child, adolescent, and adult psychiatrist with Texas-based Mindpath Health, told Healthline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This can be a very difficult transition for mothers and fathers, but fathers especially since they don’t get the chance to carry the child during the course of pregnancy and it can sometimes take more time to truly feel connected,” Khan explained. “The psychological adjustment often involves having to manage the difficult sensory responses that occur when a child is crying, seemingly in pain or distress, or feeling ill.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Parental mindset</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Khan said there’s a big shift in mindset for first-time parents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Priorities must be shifted and you may not be able to find time to relax the same way you did after a long day at work or have the ability to go out with friends late into the night,” Khan said. “The lack of sleep can also further complicate this adjustment and fathers often experience irritability, impatience, and extreme exhaustion as a result.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauren-cook-mckay-70838721a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lauren Cook-McKay</a>, a licensed marriage and family therapist as well as vice president of marketing for Connecticut-based Divorce Answers, told Healthline men go through their own hormone changes when they become fathers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The man’s cortisol and testosterone levels generally dip within the first few weeks of being a father,” Cook-McKay said. “This somehow makes fathers less aggressive, bringing them close to their children. New fathers also experience an increase in prolactin, oxytocin, and estradiol, which causes a man to exhibit nurturing behaviors.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>How the change happens</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The “dad brain” doesn’t just happen overnight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Parental psychological adjustment determines parental involvement,” Cook-McKay said. “Parents who have poor parental psychological adjustments tend to be less involved with their children. Engaging with an infant can help produce positive effects in terms of responsiveness and attentiveness.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.bewellwithdrhayley.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Hayley Nelson</a>&nbsp;is a neuroscientist, psychology professor, and founder of The Academy of Cognitive and Behavioral Neuroscience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She told Healthline becoming a parent is a significant time for the brain, as it learns from new experiences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Your life changes in the blink of an eye and you are now in charge of communicating with a non-verbal, seemingly helpless child,” Nelson said. “It’s a perfect time for increased empathy, too.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nelson said there’s more research to be done on the brain effects of things such as fear, learning, and reward when becoming a father, which she said all affect mothers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Future studies investigating brain changes in fatherhood considering hormonal changes, as well as effects from sleep deprivation and stress, could help further elucidate what is occurring in the brain after childbirth,” Nelson said. “Not only in the biological mother but also from the father or other caregivers, biological or not.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Can new fathers have postpartum depression?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, they most certainly can.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At least according to a&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0192513X19833111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research article</a>&nbsp;published in the Journal of Family Issues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New parents should be aware of this possibility and doctors should be on the lookout for it, say the researchers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Information for the study came from blogs, websites, forums, and chat rooms where new fathers were sharing their stories.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In those postings, fathers said they didn’t know that men could have postpartum depression and women who saw the signs were unsure what to call it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New fathers were frustrated by the lack of information and that the information they did find focused on mothers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just like many new moms, new dads also said they felt overwhelmed, exhausted, and trapped.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many felt neglected by their wives, the healthcare system, and society. Some came to resent the constant needs of the baby.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The research team, led by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unlv.edu/people/brandon-eddy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brandon Eddy</a>, couple and family therapy professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, acknowledged several study limitations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The researchers didn’t have access to the fathers to ask specific questions or to verify who they were.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They couldn’t validate if the fathers received a diagnosis of postpartum depression from a physician or mental health professional.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They also had no way of knowing if the fathers had experienced depression before, or if it was present before the baby was born.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Mounting evidence</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like women, men can develop depression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there’s no specific measurement to assess postpartum depression in fathers as there is for mothers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This isn’t the first study to tackle the issue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/133/5/836.long" target="_blank">2014 longitudinal, population-based study</a>&nbsp;noted that the rate of depression in fathers worldwide ranges from 5 to 10 percent. The study found that the rate is higher among fathers who don’t live with their children. Also, men who live with their children show increasing depressive symptoms as their kids grow to age 5.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14675298" target="_blank">2004 review of studiesTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;found that paternal depression ranged anywhere from 1.2 to 25.5 percent in the sampled communities. But depression among men whose partners had postpartum depression jumped to 24 to 50 percent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/postpartum-depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20376617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>, fathers who are young, have a history of depression, or have relationship or financial problems are most at risk of postpartum depression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Doctors see it in clinical practice</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr. Michael Brodsky is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lacare.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LA Care Health Plan’s</a>&nbsp;medical director for behavioral health and social services in California.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brodsky told Healthline that being a qualitative study, this particular research doesn’t say much about how many men are affected by postpartum depression or how long it lasts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“But the study does a good job of describing the sorts of themes that come up when depressed new fathers write about their experiences on the internet,” he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brodsky explained that the study confirms what he sees in clinical practice all the time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Young men of reproductive age who, while seeking to be supportive of their romantic partners and their newborn child, are at risk of feeling discouraged, depressed, exhausted, or overwhelmed by the pressures and obligations of new parenthood,” he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As many stressors as there are associated with having a new baby, Brodsky said that other things can factor into a depressed mood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“For example, job performance may suffer as a result of the sleep deprivation tied to caring for a newborn, leading to increased conflict with supervisors. Or the loss of supportive relationships with friends or relatives may deepen a new father’s sense of depression or hopelessness. These types of stressors may increase the risk of developing depression,” he explained.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr. Ilan Shapiro is a pediatrician with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.altamed.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AltaMed Health Services</a>&nbsp;in California and a fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He agrees that postpartum depression in fathers is a reality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Take lack of sleep, change in the entire dynamics of life, a baby who depends on you and demands a lot of time — putting everything together, the entire family is exposed to this stress,” he told Healthline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“When you’re chronically stressed, it affects cortisol and other stress hormones. Stress hormones are good, but under continuing pressure and anxiety, it wears down the immune system. We need to be alert to help everybody,” said Shapiro.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Some men are reluctant to talk</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fathers in the study felt pressure to conform to stereotypical “tough guy” roles and to keep their feelings to themselves for fear of appearing weak.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the researchers, men are less likely than women to seek professional help for depression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brodsky said it’s not easy for men to admit to symptoms of clinical depression or to speak in terms of postpartum depression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“In some ways, it may be easier for men to talk about depression because some male celebrities have been willing to discuss similar struggles. For example, the pop star Justin Bieber recently has talked about his struggles with depression and seeking treatment,” Brodsky added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shapiro said that getting men to talk about the condition is the first step.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“When you’re in a place of postpartum depression, you’re not seeing the light. Everything is negative,” he said. “Moving out of that realm is important for you and your family. Not just for the parents, but for the kids. That’s the biggest motivator. To help your family. If you see changes that are more than usual stress, something is wrong and it’s better to have a conversation.”</p>

<h2><a>Diagnosing postpartum depression</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both men and women can develop depression after the birth of a baby.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brodsky noted, though, that the new edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders defines “depression with peripartum onset” as having to occur within four weeks before or after the person gives birth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“As a result, that diagnosis is limited to women,” he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Brodsky, signs of major depression in men include sleep and appetite changes, decreased interested in enjoyable activities, trouble concentrating, and low energy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It might also include feelings of sadness, guilt, and thoughts of self-harm.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“If you have more than four of these symptoms on most days for two weeks or more, you may be depressed,” said Brodsky.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Getting treatment</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brodsky said it’s helpful if new fathers have someone they can confide in, whether that’s the mother of their child, a friend, relative, or a coworker.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“New fathers can also take advantage of the baby’s checkups to talk with their child’s pediatrician about feeling overwhelmed. For new fathers who are feeling more desperate or in urgent need of help, support is available through employee assistance programs at many workplaces or national hotlines such as 1-800-273-TALK,” said Brodsky.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Without treatment, things can escalate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“When there’s complete neglect of our own health and safety, and thoughts of self-harm, we can’t take care of ourselves and this can reflect on the kids,” said Shapiro.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Men should seek treatment for postpartum depression just as they would for a physical problem, said Shapiro.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I always give the example that you use medicine when you have a headache or infection. It’s the same thing when the brain has a chemical imbalance we can treat with medicine,” he continued.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We need a bridge to talking with someone to align thoughts and feelings. If there’s a chemical reaction inside the brain making this harder to treat, then we need to do both, in some cases, to improve the health of the entire family,” said Shapiro.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shapiro suggests that pediatricians should screen for general depression in the first months when they see parents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Many see their pediatrician more often than they do their own doctors. Pediatricians need to be alert. We need to have objective screening like we ask moms to answer, be open for it, knowing if someone has a high score, what to do with it. Here we do have a psychologist and licensed clinical social worker, but it depends where you are. Just looking for and being conscious that something could be wrong is important for everybody,” he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There are a lot of stigmas, but treating postpartum depression makes a huge difference,” said Shapiro.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.obama.org%2Ffellowship%2F2019-fellows%2Fcharles-daniels%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cjpeeples%40healthline.com%7Cb7128327d869463d2ef608d82cccef7c%7C4289d6102cfd46218c9644a1518ddb0a%7C0%7C0%7C637308605984067514&amp;sdata=6oqo9DlIDVADyBWPKWppyPGF0VhKLq4xQg0sL8ASNu0%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charles Daniels</a>&nbsp;grew up in a household without his father. Throughout his childhood, he watched his mother struggle as a single parent while he grappled with understanding why his father was absent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“As I got older, I learned that my dad struggled with a variety of mental health issues, and I began to understand how difficult it must have been for him to navigate emotional issues and relationships without the appropriate support,” Daniels told Healthline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As an adult, Daniels channeled his empathy for his father and other dads in similar situations into a greater good.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2012, he founded&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fathersuplift.org%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cjpeeples%40healthline.com%7Cb7128327d869463d2ef608d82cccef7c%7C4289d6102cfd46218c9644a1518ddb0a%7C0%7C0%7C637308605984077509&amp;sdata=Vs%2FXuoq4A4wxPIPxo6rVOqta9IrWoapzzzntFxKeFFo%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank">Fathers’ UpLift</a>, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit organization which provides mental health support to fathers and helps them become engaged in their children’s lives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There is complexity when it comes to getting men involved in therapy in Black communities. Past treatment of Black men in mental health facilities and lack of trust are barriers. We provide guidance to men who had experiences like my own father had,” said Daniels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Samantha Fils-Daniels, co-founder of Fathers’ UpLift and therapist at the organization, said talking about disparities in the Black community is part of therapy sessions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We talk about race in the sessions and stigma and how we understand from a personal perspective what fathers have experienced. We want them to be comfortable with the language and people in the office,” Fils-Daniels told Healthline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The approach proves effective —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fathersuplift.org/our-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">95 percent of fathers</a>&nbsp;who received help from the organization reported an improved sense of self and improved relations with their kids.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Based on the men we work with, what we have found is that when they feel important, they feel valuable and continue to work toward being the people they want to be toward other people,” said Daniels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He believes the reason fathers continue to get help from Fathers’ UpLift is based on this notion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The commissioner of the Department of Public Health asked [some of the fathers we helped] what was different about our program or what made them participate in mental health therapy with us, and they told her, ‘It’s because they make us feel important,'” said Daniels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Facing trauma to reduce trauma</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fathers’ UpLift started off organically and was built by word-of-mouth from dads who the organization helped.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, it has worked with more than 5,000 fathers and receives referrals from child welfare offices, local mental health and substance abuse programs, hospitals, and schools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because Massachusetts is a state where almost everyone is insured, as a mental health and substance abuse treatment facility, the organization can bill the state for services. For fathers who don’t have insurance, Fathers’ UpLift taps into funds they receive through grants.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fathers seek out therapy for different matters, including legal issues with the court system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“When they come in our doors, they are looking for reconnections with their children and families, and want to access therapy to help with that. We coach them along with how to dress in court, and how to show that they are doing their due diligence in terms of making effort,” said Fils-Daniels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A big part of therapy deals with addressing their past trauma.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We have found that many fathers don’t understand how their past trauma has affected how they parent or how they’re not in their children’s lives at the moment,” Fils-Daniels said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She provides a full psychological assessment and talk therapy to work through past trauma.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stephanie E. Johnson, owner of&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.navipsych.com/" target="_blank">NaviPsych</a>&nbsp;and executive director of the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.ltyfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Lee Thompson Young Foundation</a>&nbsp;in Atlanta, Georgia, said Black men who have experienced personal, environmental, racial, and/or socioeconomic traumas and who are willing to explore how those experiences have effected how they think, feel, and act will find insight into themselves that can positively affect how they parent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, if they’re not aware that past experiences were indeed traumatic, then they’ll also be unaware of how their actions affect their parenting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Johnson said this is where trauma-informed care can help them understand and respond to trauma.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Many therapists have added this tool to their tool boxes of skills because research on trauma has broadened the definition of trauma due to the deep effects that negative past experiences can have on people over time,” Johnson told Healthline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She said there are six guiding principles to trauma-informed care:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>safety</li><li>trustworthiness and transparency</li><li>peer support</li><li>collaboration and mutuality</li><li>empowerment and choice</li><li>cultural, historical, and gender issues</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Addressing these principles are essential to allowing healing to happen, which can yield a more present and engaged parent,” said Johnson.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fils-Daniels shared a story of a father she worked with in 2012 who had served time in jail.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“From our first meeting, he wanted to be connected with his kids, even though they were older and had their own kids. We worked with him for substance abuse and other mental health issues that he was having,” she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With time, the man moved into his own apartment, started his own construction business, and connected with his children and grandchildren.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“His children initially didn’t want anything to do with him. Over time, he was able to understand his past trauma and [relay it to] his children, so they could be aware of it for themselves. It’s great to see how we can support a whole unit, not only him, but his children and grandchildren and his place in society too,” said Fils-Daniels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another father, Javan Tooley, who the program helped, recently sat down to talk about Black fatherhood with Oprah, Killer Mike, and Tyler Perry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We helped him focus on reentering society after being incarcerated for years for something he didn’t do. He attributes us for helping him get back into society. He has a baby girl now and was able to buy her a crib with donations we received from a giving campaign. He’s now a public speaker and making a difference in Boston,” said Daniels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Daniels recently talked with Tooley on his podcast, “<a href="https://www.fathersuplift.org/afar-podcast-absent-for-a-reason/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AFAR-Absent for a Reason</a>.”</p>

<h2><a>Teaching others how to work with fathers</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to providing therapy to dads, Fathers’ Uplift has a Male Engagement Institute built on the premise that the successful preparation of mental health professionals, who are experienced in engaging men and their families, is dependent on the ongoing development of professional competencies and practical hands-on experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We found that the curriculum of many schools of social work and psychology are not necessarily training their students on how to work with Black and brown men effectively, so we provide that training, and we also provide training for child welfare workers that are looking to increase their ability to engage fathers and men of color in their respective organizations,” said Daniels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When students graduate from the institute, they’re welcome to take part in an alumni program and work in a coaching capacity for Fathers’ UpLift.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the current state of racial discrimination in the country, having well-equipped mental health professionals is more important than ever, said Daniels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This current state makes [men of color] feel valueless and not important. Mental health professionals have a very important role to give them a space to voice their concerns and really work through those difficult emotions when they see young men being killed who look like them,” said Daniels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Johnson agreed, and said Fathers’ UpLift is the perfect resource for dads during this time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think that Fathers’ UpLift is a great example of the type of support system that is needed when individuals, especially those who have experienced trauma, are engaged in the healing process. Social support is vital to remaining engaged in changing one’s life for the better,” she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2019, Daniels was named an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.obama.org/fellowship/2019-fellows/charles-daniels/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Obama Foundation Fellow</a>&nbsp;for his impact.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The Obama Foundation’s mission is to bring like-minded individuals together to make a collective change and a difference in the world, so to be involved with a community that is bigger than myself and bigger than the work that we’re doing nationally means the world to me,” he said.</p>

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>According to an observational study in 529,090 couples, there was a 35 percent increase in the chance of birth defects in newborns if the father regularly drank alcohol in the 6 months leading to conception.</strong></li><li><strong>The types of birth defects tracked in the study included congenital heart disease, limb anomalies, clefts, digestive tract anomalies, gastroschisis, and neural tube defects.</strong></li><li><strong>Experts note several limitations to the study, including the fact that it did not track the amount of alcohol consumed before conception.</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New evidence suggests a link between paternal alcohol consumption before conception and the chances of fetal birth defects.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2021.0291?guestAccessKey=9df1b616-6a8e-45e4-a993-68b5f00ca9bb&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=041921" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studyTrusted Source</a>, published in JAMA Pediatrics on April 19, found that paternal drinking is associated with an increased risk of sperm abnormalities, which could lead to defects like congenital heart disease, limb anomalies, clefts, and digestive tract anomalies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The association between alcohol consumption and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/birth-defects">birth defects</a>&nbsp;has been most closely studied in mothers, but researchers have recently started taking a closer look at how paternal drinking affects babies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The study adds to a growing pile of evidence that paternal alcohol consumption can potentially negatively affect the health of the baby.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s unclear why paternal drinking may lead to birth defects, but early evidence suggests alcohol changes the shape, size, and motility of sperm and could also alter the DNA that’s passed down to children.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the chances of birth defects remain low, regardless of alcohol consumption.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This study raises questions that maybe both partners should be equally responsible in terms of when they are planning to create the new life,” said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/specialists/lubna_pal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Lubna Pal</a>, a Yale Medicine reproductive endocrinologist and professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive services at Yale School of Medicine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Birth defects more commonly reported by fathers who drink alcohol&nbsp;</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The researchers recruited 529,090 couples who were planning to become pregnant within 6 months.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of the participating couples, 364,939 fathers did not drink alcohol before conception (defined as at least one time drinking a week) and 164,151 did.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The research team then tracked the rate of birth defects reported by parents 42 days after the baby was born.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, 609 total birth defects were reported, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/congenital-heart-disease">congenital heart disease</a>, limb anomalies,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/branchial-cleft-cyst">clefts</a>, digestive tract anomalies,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/gastroschisis-vs-omphalocele">gastroschisis</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/congenital-brain-defects">neural tube defects</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among the fathers who consumed alcohol, there were 363 birth defects. Among the fathers who did not consume alcohol, there were 246 birth defects.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The research team found that babies had a 35 percent greater chance of having a birth defect if their father regularly drank once a week or more in the 6 months leading up to conception.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, babies had a 55 percent greater chance of developing clefts if their father drank regularly before conception.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the researchers, the epidemiological evidence suggests paternal drinking before conception can damage the sperm cells and increase the chances of birth defects.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The researchers also suggest the findings should inform guidance on paternal drinking to help reduce the chances of defects.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The study does not confirm a direct link, but it does raise questions that there may be preventable strategies that both partners can take to improve the health of the baby, according to Pal.</p>

<h2><a>Why might paternal drinking have this impact?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Research on paternal drinking has historically focused on the effects of maternal alcohol consumption.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mothers have historically been advised against drinking before conception, but guidance for paternal drinking before conception has been scarce.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Fertility is a team sport. There are two players involved, but the burden has disproportionately fallen on women for [the] longest time,” Pal said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurjpc/article/27/4/410/5924865" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2020 review</a>&nbsp;of 55 studies also found a strong correlation between paternal drinking and babies being born with a birth defect like congenital heart disease (CHD).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to that study, drinking alcohol within 3 months of conception was linked to a 44 percent higher chance of CHD. Furthermore, the risk appeared to be greatest in fathers who drank heavily.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s unclear why paternal drinking may be linked to a higher rate of birth defects.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Past&nbsp;<a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/4/9/e005462" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">evidence</a>&nbsp;suggests alcohol affects the size, motility, and shape of sperm cells. Other&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515627/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">researchTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;suggests exposure to alcohol can alter the father’s DNA and be inherited by the offspring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Early&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20117050/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">evidenceTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;suggests the effects are not permanent, and it might only take 3 months for the sperm to become healthy again once the alcohol consumption stops.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>More research is needed to understand the link</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This new observational study raises questions that there might be a link between the father’s lifestyle choices before conception and the health of the baby.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But much more research is needed to explore the potential mechanisms at play along with other contributing factors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.northwell.edu/find-care/find-a-doctor/urology/dr-boback-m-berookhim-md-11367167" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Boback Berookhim</a>, the director of male fertility and microsurgery at Lenox Hill Hospital, would like to see more data on how much alcohol the fathers consumed before conception.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It would be very important to know how much is too much — a question which is not answered here,” Berookhim said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Given the overall low rate of birth defects, even in fathers who consumed alcohol, more data is needed to determine whether alcohol abstinence before conception is beneficial, according to Berookhim.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I tell potential fathers to moderate the alcohol intake but do not suggest complete abstinence,” Berookhim said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
